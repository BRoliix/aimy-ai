# Error: "OpenAI API key not found"
Solution: Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env file
Check: echo $OPENAI_API_KEY (should show your key)

# Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
Solution: Implement request throttling or upgrade OpenAI plan
Temporary fix: Reduce OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS in .env

# Error: "Model not available"
Solution: Update OPENAI_MODEL to available model (gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo)
```

#### Voice Interface Problems
```bash
# Voice not working on macOS
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio

# Voice not working on Linux
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
sudo apt-get install espeak espeak-data

# Voice not working on Windows
# Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

#### Web Interface Issues
```bash
# Port already in use
Error: "Address already in use"
Solution: Change FLASK_PORT in .env or kill existing process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# CORS errors in browser
Solution: Set ENABLE_CORS=true in .env
For production: Configure proper CORS origins
```

#### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Slow response times
- Reduce OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS for faster responses
